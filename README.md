# Lim Jin Yung 🐯

I am final semester student in Monash University Malaysia and also working part time in The Hacker Collective as Junior Backend Developer 👨🏻‍💻 I started my web development journey since 2018 by joining a bootcamp in Next Academy and there is where I built my very first web app using Ruby on Rails. After realize how I can built amazing things like this, I started to learn and explore more in web development, especially backend.

Later than I explored Flask and used Flask to worked on my Final Year Project (IoT based Attendance System with Data Analytics) where get a HD for the FYP and currently trying to publish the paper to Applied Computer
