		<h2>Here's the definitive list of every Stan Lee appearance</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>In Iron Man (2008)</strong></li>
				<ul>
					<li>credited as "Himself", appears at a gala cavorting with three blondes, where Tony Stark mistakes him for Hugh Hefner. In the theatrical release of the film, Stark simply greets Lee as "Hef" and moves on; another version of the scene was filmed where Stark realizes his mistake, but Lee graciously responds, "That's okay, I get this all the time." In 2008, Stan Lee named this as his favorite cameo appearance to that date.</li>
				</ul>
			<li><strong>In The Incredible Hulk (2008)</strong></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Lee appears as a hapless citizen who accidentally ingests a soft drink mixed with Bruce Banner's blood, which gave him a little more kick than he is looking for while saying, "Wow." He subsequently drops it and falls ill to gamma radiation sickness, leading to the discovery of Dr. Banner's location in a bottling plant in Brazil.</li>
				</ul>
			<li><strong>In Iron Man 2 (2010)</strong></li>
				<ul>
					<li>during the Stark Expo, Lee, wearing suspenders and a red shirt and black and purple tie, is mistakenly greeted by Tony Stark as "Larry King".</li>
				</ul>
			<li><strong>In Thor (2011)</strong></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Lee appears among many people at the site where Thor's hammer Mjolnir lands on earth. He tears the bed off his pickup truck in an attempt to pull Mjolnir out of the ground with a chain and causes everyone in the scene to laugh by asking, "Did it work?". His character is credited as "Stan the Man", a nickname he had adopted in the Silver Age of Comic Books.</li>
				</ul>
			<li><strong>In Captain America: The First Avenger(2011)</strong></li>
				<ul>
					<li> Lee plays a general in World War II who mistakes another man for Captain America/Steve Rogers, commenting, "I thought he'd be taller." Lee had nothing to do with the basic creation of the title character. However, Lee began his writing career in the character's original series where he created the idea of Captain America using his shield as a throwing weapon. Furthermore, he was responsible for reviving the character in the Silver Age of Comic Books and co-wrote most of the character's stories in The Avengers and his solo stories in that period.</li>
				</ul>
			<li><strong>In The Avengers(2012)</strong></li>
				<ul>
					<li> Lee's character is interviewed about the Avengers saving Manhattan. Lee's character responds, "Superheroes in New York? Give me a break", and then returns to his game of chess. He also appears in a deleted scene in which, when a waitress flirts with Steve Rogers, Lee says to him, "Ask for her number, you moron!"</li>
				</ul>
